# IDC-21-Days-SQL-Challenge

SQL learning journey with the 21 Days SQL Challenge organized by Indian Data Club and DPDzero as the title sponsor.

## **📅 Challenge Breakdown**

- **Duration**: 21 days
- **Focus**: SQL fundamentals to advanced (queries, joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, optimization, modeling, and analytics)
- **Structure**: Daily topics paired with practical datasets & problem statements with resources.
- **Goal:** Equip you with strong SQL skills to query, clean, model, and analysis data — essential for roles in **Data Analysis, Data Engineering, Data Science & AI and Software Development** 🚀

## 🗂️ Dataset

Here is the dataset that will be used throughout the challenge.  
You can use it with any **Database Management System (DBMS)** of your choice.  
Our suggestion in the original challenge was **PostgreSQL & PgAdmin**,  
but in my case, I’m using **Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)** for all query execution and practice.

Below you will find the link to the actual dataset that was modified to better suit the challenge,  
along with SQL dump (for PgAdmin restore), and CSV for MySQL Workbench import.  
For MS SQL Server users, the CSV can be easily imported using the *Import Flat File* wizard or `BULK INSERT`.

- **Dataset:** [Hospital Beds Management - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaderz/hospital-beds-management) *(Modified to better suit the challenge)*

### 🧰 DBMS Used

- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Tool:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- **Version:** SQL Server 2022
